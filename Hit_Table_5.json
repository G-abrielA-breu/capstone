companys properties but allowed the company to prevent the criminal actors from accessing any customer bank account numbers or payment card information since that time operations at the companys domestic properties have returned to normal and virtually all of the companys guestfacing systems have been restored the company continues to focus on restoring the remaining impacted guestfacing systems and the company anticipates that these systems will be restored in the coming days the company believes that the operational disruption experienced at its affected properties during the month of september will have a negative impact on its third quarter  results predominantly in its las vegas operations and a minimal impact during the fourth quarter the company does not expect that it will have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations for the year specifically the company estimates a negative impact from the cyber security issue in september of approximately  million to adjusted property ebitdar for the las vegas strip resorts and regional operations collectively while the company experienced impacts to occupancy due to the availability of bookings through the companys website and mobile applications it was mostly contained to the month of september which was  compared to  in the prior year period the company believes it is wellpositioned to have a strong fourth quarter with record results expected in november primarily driven by formula  the company is further forecasting occupancy to be  in october compared to  in the prior year period and to fully rebound in november for the las vegas strip resorts the company has also incurred less than  million in onetime expenses in the third quarter related to the cybersecurity issue which consisted of technology consulting services legal fees and expenses of other third party advisors although the company currently believes that its cybersecurity insurance will be sufficient to cover the financial impact to its business as a result of the operational disruptions the onetime expenses described above and future expenses the full scope of the costs and related impacts of this issue has not been determined based on the ongoing investigation the company believes that the unauthorized thirdparty activity is contained at this time the company has determined however that the criminal actors obtained for some of the companys customers that transacted with the company prior to march  personal information including name contact information such as
