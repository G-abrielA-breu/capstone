    "1283699": "our investigation is still ongoing, but the malicious activity appears to be fully contained at this time, and there is currently no evidence that the bad actor was able to breach or compromise our systems or our network. our systems and policies prevented the most sensitive types of customer information from being accessed, and as a result, based on our investigation to date, customer accounts and finances were not put at risk directly by this event. the api abused by the bad actor does not provide access to any customer payment card information (pci), social security numbers/tax ids, driver\u2019s license or other government id numbers, passwords/pins or other financial account information, so none of this information was exposed. rather, the impacted api is only able to provide a limited set of customer account data, including name, billing address, email, phone number, date of birth, t-mobile account number and information such as the number of lines on the account and plan features. the preliminary result from our investigation indicates that the bad actor(s) obtained data from this api for approximately 37 million current postpaid and prepaid customer accounts, though many of these accounts did not include the full data set. we currently believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted api starting on or around november 25, 2022. we are continuing to diligently investigate the unauthorized activity. in addition, we have notified certain federal agencies about the incident, and we are concurrently working with law enforcement. additionally, we have begun notifying customers whose information may have been obtained by the bad actor in accordance with applicable state and federal requirements. as we have previously disclosed, in 2021, we commenced a substantial multi-year investment working with leading external cybersecurity experts to enhance our cybersecurity capabilities and transform our approach to cybersecurity. we have made substantial progress to date, and protecting our customers\u2019 data remains a top priority. we will continue to make substantial investments to strengthen our cybersecurity program. we may incur significant expenses in connection with this incident. although we are unable to predict the full impact of this incident on customer behavior in the future, including whether a change in our customers\u2019 behavior could negatively impact our results of operations on an ongoing basis, we presently do not expect that it will have a material effect on the company\u2019s operations. forward-looking statements this current report on form 8-k includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. today i\u2019m announcing that we have entered into long-term partnerships with the industry-leading cybersecurity experts at mandiant, and with consulting firm kpmg llg. we know we need additional expertise to take our cybersecurity efforts to the next level\u2014and we\u2019ve brought in the help. these arrangements are part of a substantial multi-year investment to adopt best-in-class practices and transform our approach. this is all about assembling the firepower we need to improve our ability to fight back against criminals and building a future-forward strategy to protect t-mobile and our customers. as i previously mentioned, mandiant has been part of our forensic investigation since the start of the incident, and we are now expanding our relationship to draw on the expertise they\u2019ve gained from the front lines of large-scale data breaches and use their scalable security solutions to become more resilient to future cyber threats. they will support us as we develop an immediate and longer-term strategic plan to mitigate and stabilize cybersecurity risks across our enterprise. simultaneously, we are partnering with consulting firm kpmg, a recognized global leader in cybersecurity consulting. kpmg\u2019s cybersecurity team will bring its deep expertise and interdisciplinary approach to perform a thorough review of all t-mobile security policies and performance measurement. they will focus on controls to identify gaps and areas of improvement. mandiant and kpmg will work side-by-side with our teams to map out definitive actions that will be designed to protect our customers and others from malicious activity now and into the future. i am confident in these partnerships and optimistic about the opportunity they present to help us come out of this terrible event in a much stronger place with improved security measures. as we learn and evolve, we will always work to keep you informed of any important updates or relevant changes. i also commit to you that while we\u2019re starting on this path with humility, we will bring to it the same un-carrier energy that we have used for years to help transform the wireless industry for the
